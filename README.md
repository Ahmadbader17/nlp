Demystifying NLP by implementing core concepts from scratch in Python



# üß† NLP From Scratch

A repository dedicated to understanding the core concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by building them from the ground up.

### ‚ú® Motivation

The goal of this repository isn't to create production-ready libraries, but to gain a deeper, intuitive understanding of how fundamental NLP algorithms and models work. By coding them from scratch, we can demystify the magic behind modern language technologies.

### üöÄ Projects & Concepts

This repository is structured by topic. Each directory contains a focused, well-commented implementation of a core NLP concept.

* **01-Text-Processing:**
    * Tokenization (Word, Sentence)
    * Stop Word Removal
    * Stemming & Lemmatization
* **02-Vectorization:**
    * Bag-of-Words (BoW)
    * Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
* **03-Classic-ML-Models:**
    * Naive Bayes for Text Classification
    * Sentiment Analysis
* **04-Word-Embeddings:**
    * Implementing a simple Word2Vec (Skip-Gram) model
* **05-Attention-Mechanism:**
    * Building the Attention mechanism from scratch to see how it weighs word importance.

*(This list will grow as more concepts are explored!)*
